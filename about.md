Hi, I'm V. This is another random blog that contains coding and computer engineering related topics that you can find on the internet. Why have I decided to start one? One day at work, I was assigned a new project and while I was making some research on the topic, I stumbled upon a tool I have used before, but I could not remember its workflow and so I spent some hours to figure out again how it should be used. I keep notes and snippets from past projects because you never know when they could come in handy, but I usually store them on my computer and I cannot access it from work. I could open a git repository (and I believe that this may be a better solution), but I chose to start a blog because it seems like an interesting thing for me to do at the moment. Also, it is nice to share stuff with other people who are working on solving problems they are stuck on for which you have may have a fix.

So, I started fiddling around with GitHub Pages and found a great theme [here](https://github.com/poole/hyde), which is the one that this site is using right now. I don't have a lot of experinece in this field (I don't have a Bachelor's Degree yet) so let's hope that things will go well. Have an awesome day!

V.
